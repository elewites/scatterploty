## Purpose

The intent of this project was to familiarize myself with the javascript library [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
I created a frontend which pulls in data from a [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwyaWZBhBGEiwACslQowJ6cw8Y_nNomUZUrVQxqKiHNMIhh1XKSxCzBvngTIXgVJ-EQXxjhRoCDuYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) database. 
The data is displayed on scatterplot, plotting the age and height of the given person on x-axis against their height in y-axis. 

## Functionality
The user is able to add and remove data as they please. 

The user is able to hover over a specific data point in the scatterplot to see to which row it corresponds on the tabular representation of the data.
