##Purpose
The intent of this project was to familiarize myself with the javascript library [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
I created a frontend which pulls in data from a firebase database. 
The data is displayed on scatterplot, plotting the age of the given person on x-axis agaisnt their height in y-axis. 
The user is able to add and remove data as they please.
